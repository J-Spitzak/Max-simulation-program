# Max-simulation-program
A project by Max and Jason to simulate bird populations in Rock Creek Parkway

We (Max and Jason) are students of Arlingotn Tech High School. This project origionally started as Max's senior capstone project but is now a seperate project

The project is under a MIT license, feel free to do whatever you want with it (I am not sure if it's neccesary under the MIT license but we would like credit)

The simulation framework was origionally written in python and was going to use flask but is now written in javascript with the intent to use JDH. JDH is a html-less library that uses only javascript. This may not be a permanent solution because jdh is not a proven solution for tablets and i-pads which is what is given to elementary and middle school students in APS.
